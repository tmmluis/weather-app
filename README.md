## ðŸŒž WeatherNow

A very simple weather app built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
It uses [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) free API to fetch weather and geolocation data.

You can see it in action [here](https://grand-bienenstitch-8b9f8a.netlify.app/).
